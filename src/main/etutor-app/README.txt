ABOUT THIS FOLDER
=========================
The documents and folders contain herein (inside "etutor-app")
serve two important needs:

1. The configuration file "jdbc.config.properties" separates the
   database connection information from the Spring applicationContext.xml
   file. This can be useful when one does not want the developers to
   have access to the connection details.
   
2. The "logs" and "logs.bu" folders contain log files generated by
   the application and archived in .zip format.
   
While the enclosing "etutor-app" folder is included with this
project so it can be version-controlled by Git, it SHOULD NOT
be used in its current location. Please copy the folder to some
other location on the drive where you are planning to run the
program, and then make sure the you change the applicationContext.xml
Spring config file to point to it using a valid path. 

Also, you must edit the path in the logback.xml (the config file for logging)
which is in the same location as applicationContext.xml (root of the
classpath). Make sure the logback.xml file contains an "ETUTOR_HOME"
entry that points to the correct path for the "logs" directory.
